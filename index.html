          <p>Data obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System show that a positive
            correlation exists between states' poverty rate and their percentage of population lacking healthcare.  This comes as no
            surprise - it makes sense logically that the greater the population you have living below the poverty line, the more
            people you'll have that can't afford medical care and health insurance.  
          </p>

          <p>As seen in the above scatter plot, Texas has the greatest number of people lacking healthcare at over 24% of the population
            with a poverty rate approaching 18%.  Other states struggling most include Georgia, Louisiana, New Mexico, and
            Mississippi.  A couple of states, West Virginia and Kentucky, do not show as great a percentage lacking healthcare
            despite having poverty rates as high or greater than the previously mentioned struggling states.  This could be due to lower state
            populations but more in depth research is needed to account for these differences.
          </p>

          <p>The fact remains that the have-nots in our society also go without proper medical care, a grim reality that we must all work together
            to fight so that no individual goes without the care they need.  If everyone were to have regular exams and proactive care, it could ultimately
            ease the burden on our medical system by keeping individuals healthy - avoiding extreme and costly procedures for ailments that could have been
            prevented.
